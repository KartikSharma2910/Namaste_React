Node Modules Contains all the dependencies.
Like we installed Parcel -> It have some dependencies -> It's dependencies have some more dependencies.

Parcel ->
- Creates a dev build
- Creates a local server
- HMR = Hot module replacemnet (Because it uses a file watching algorithm that is written in C++)
- It is doing caching (Which provides faster builds).
- Image optimization for us is done by parcel. (it is the most expensive task).
- Bundling
- Minification
- Compress files (So that size is small).
- Differential Bundling (To support older browsers).

Remove main:"index.js" from package.json while using parcel.
